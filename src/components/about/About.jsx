                <p>Where do we begin?</p>
                <p>Well, it all started in late 2019 in Surry Hills, Sydney.</p>
                <p>Our CEO, Nicole, had big aspirations to become a houseplant queen, but things didn't quite plan out that way.</p>
                <p>(Plant) lives were lost, tears were shed, but hope was never lost. The biggest concern for Nicole was where this precious plant matter was going. If they were going to a good place and giving new life else where, the loss wouldn't be as great</p>
                <p>This was essential how AfterLeaf was born</p>
